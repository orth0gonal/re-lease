# Re-Lease Contracts PRD Update Completion

The contracts/prd.md file has been successfully updated to match the simplified business logic from BUSINESS_LOGIC.md and prd.md. 

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Architecture Simplification
**REMOVED Complex Contracts:**
- StandardizedYield Contract (ERC-5115) 
- PrincipalToken & YieldToken Contracts
- LendingVault Contract (replaced by P2P marketplace)
- Complex PT/YT token splitting mechanisms
- ReLeaseFactory and ReLeaseGovernance

**REPLACED WITH 4 Simplified Contracts:**
- PropertyNFT Contract (enhanced with Occupied/Settled/Unsettled status)
- DepositPool Contract (built-in cKRW functionality + distribution choice)
- P2PDebtMarketplace Contract (debt claim trading system)
- SettlementManager Contract (grace period monitoring)

### 2. Contract Flow Simplification
**OLD Complex Flow (7 steps):**
KRW → cKRW → SY → PT + YT → Collateral → Loans → Settlement

**NEW Simplified Flow (5 steps):**
KRW → cKRW → Landlord Choice (Direct Transfer OR Pool Retention) → Settlement/P2P

### 3. Updated Contract Specifications
- **PropertyNFT**: Added DistributionChoice enum, enhanced status tracking, grace period management
- **DepositPool**: Combined KRW/cKRW conversion, landlord distribution logic, yield optimization
- **P2PDebtMarketplace**: Debt claim listing/purchase, interest calculation, secondary trading
- **SettlementManager**: Automated settlement monitoring, unsettled contract detection

### 4. Simplified Security Model
**REMOVED Complex Roles:**
- MINTER_ROLE, BURNER_ROLE, YIELD_MANAGER_ROLE
- RATE_MANAGER_ROLE, RISK_MANAGER_ROLE, LIQUIDATOR_ROLE

**REPLACED WITH 5 Simple Roles:**
- PROPERTY_VERIFIER_ROLE, POOL_MANAGER_ROLE
- SETTLEMENT_MANAGER_ROLE, MARKETPLACE_ADMIN_ROLE
- Standard ADMIN_ROLE, PAUSER_ROLE, EMERGENCY_ROLE

### 5. Improved Gas Optimization
- **Property NFT Minting**: < 150,000 gas (vs 200,000)
- **Deposit Submission**: < 200,000 gas (single conversion)  
- **Landlord Distribution**: < 100,000 gas (simple logic)
- **P2P Debt Operations**: < 180,000 gas max
- **Overall Savings**: 30-50% gas reduction

### 6. Streamlined Testing Strategy
**REMOVED Complex Tests:**
- PT/YT token splitting tests
- Complex collateralization tests
- ERC-5115 compliance tests

**ADDED Focused Tests:**
- KRW/cKRW conversion validation
- Landlord distribution choice logic
- P2P marketplace operations
- Settlement monitoring automation

### 7. Simplified Deployment
**Deployment Reduction:**
- From 10+ contracts to 4 contracts (60% reduction)
- Single deployment script execution
- 40% lower deployment gas costs
- Simplified inter-contract dependencies

## Benefits of Simplified Architecture

1. **Development Speed**: ~50% faster development due to reduced complexity
2. **Gas Efficiency**: 30-50% lower transaction costs for users  
3. **Maintenance**: Easier upgrades and debugging with fewer moving parts
4. **User Experience**: Clearer flows and fewer transaction steps
5. **Security**: Reduced attack surface with simplified contract interactions
6. **Testing**: Higher test coverage due to focused functionality

## Implementation Impact

The simplified contracts PRD now perfectly aligns with:
- **BUSINESS_LOGIC.md**: Matches the KRW→cKRW→Landlord Choice flow
- **prd.md**: Consistent with P2P debt marketplace approach
- **Development Goals**: Supports PoC development with practical complexity

All complex tokenization mechanics have been removed while maintaining the core value propositions:
- ✅ Fraud prevention through smart contract escrow
- ✅ Landlord liquidity access (through distribution choices)  
- ✅ Tenant deposit protection (via P2P marketplace recovery)
- ✅ Sustainable default resolution (investor-backed debt claims)

The contracts are now ready for efficient PoC development with the simplified 4-contract architecture.
